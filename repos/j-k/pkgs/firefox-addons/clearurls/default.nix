  #   longDescription = ''
  #     This extension will automatically remove tracking elements from URLs to
  #     help protect your privacy when browse through the Internet.

  #     Many websites use tracking elements in the URL to mark your online
  #     activity. All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be
  #     displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removedâ€”that is exactly
  #     what ClearURLs does.
