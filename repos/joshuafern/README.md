My goal is to submit as much as I can to nixpkgs, but everything else goes here. For example:

* Packages that are only interesting for a small audience
* Pre-releases
* Old versions of packages that are no longer in Nixpkgs, but needed for legacy reason (i.e. old versions of GCC/LLVM)
* Automatic generated package sets (i.e. generate packages sets from PyPi or CPAN)
* Software with opinionated patches
* Experiments

I have enabled issues, pull requests, and even the wiki. Feel free to use them, but bugs specific to software itself should be sent upstream to the developer.
