# nur-packages

**My personal [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) repository**

## about this repository
I requested [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/) to add platformio extension for vscode but it's not merged yet. Maybe there's something not convenient or againsting philosophy but I seriously need this. that's why I created this repo.

## disclaimers 
codes under pkgs/vscode-extensions were copied from original nixpkgs repository. and then I modified some lines/directories in it. If it is violating some rules, please tell me. I'll delete this immediately.
